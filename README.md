This a repository of my (new) personal website, made with the Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) static renderer, made in Ruby.
This website is responsive and uses the great (but underrated) jalpc jekyll theme.

# Technologies used

- [Wow.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/) , a javascript library to animate the elements as you scroll! (Check their website, it's really cool);
