Have you ever heard of Atom? Atom is a text editor, similar to Sublime Text, but with a lot of different features, and much more flexibility and freedom. It's described as *A hackable text editor for the 21st century*, because it's very easy to create and change many of the settings available, and there's a lot!

Atom is my personal editor, I prefer using it than the proprietary (but relatively good) Sublime Text, and other MAINSTREAM editors like *vi/vim* or *emacs*. You can do pretty much anything you could do in these editors in Atom, and you won't have to learn lots of unintuitively shortcuts just to search or save a file, for example :)

Atom is free, made by the Github team, and uses the Electron API. Atom has a LOT of different packages, which are the core of your environment. Here I'll cover the packages that I personally use, while trying to say a little more about when to use Atom (and when not to).

## Interface

Atom interface is very familiar for those who used Sublime Text or a customized *vim*. Below you can see a screenshot with how I commonly program in Atom.

It has a right 'files' section on the right, then the files you open are displayed in the main page, and other files that you open are displayed in 'tabs', very much like Sublime Text. I removed the Menu bar from the top to have more workspace available, and I also use the Fullscreen option (F11) to have even more space.

Regarding the interface, there's probably one command that you **NEED** to know, which is to open the **Command Pallete** (Ctrl + Shift + P). With the command pallete you can access pretty much any other command by searching very quickly what you want.

## Packages

Here's the most important part, which is to cover all packages that I use and WHY, because the core of Atom is it's plugins.
