**GDB**(GNU Project Debugger) is, as the name implies, a debugger with a lot of features to make your life easy when programming in C.
Using **gdb** helps to debug C programs in real execution time, i.e. you can put *break points* in the program to evaluate the value of variables, detect when something has gone wrong, and many other uses. Here I'll cover the basics that I use to debug simple C programs.


**NOTE:** To install gdb in *Debian* or another *Debian* based distro, just use
~~~bash
$ sudo apt-get gdb
~~~

**NOTE (2):** If your program receives CLI args, the gdb have support for it using the *--args* tag, but for testing purposes it's better to just automate the input inside the program (by automatically creating a test input, without reading from the CLI).

## How to use

1.Compile it with
~~~bash
$ cc -g file.c
~~~

2.Open the generated file with
~~~bash
$ gdb a.out
~~~

3.The *gdb* should open it. Now if you want to, you can create a break point using
~~~bash
$ break file.c:xx
~~~    
Replace **'xx'** with the number of line to pause the execution;

4.Run the program with
~~~bash
$ run -v -da -Q
~~~

5.As the program executes, you can print the value of variables using
~~~bash
$ print x
~~~
where **x** is the name of the variable;

6.With *gdb*, a ***segmentation Fault*** will display more info, allowing you to debug your program more easily! To exit *gdb* and go back to your default terminal, just type
~~~bash
$ quit
~~~

This is just the very basic of *gdb*. For those who want something a little more sophisticated, I reccomend to study the *frame*, *backtrack* and navigation command in *gdb* (usually the *up* and *continue* commands). For more information and details about each argument used in the commands, I recommend the following pages:
